        question: "What is a brain tumor?",
        answer: "A brain tumor is a growth of abnormal cells that have formed in the brain. Some brain tumors are malignant (cancerous), while others are not (non-malignant, non-cancerous or benign). A brain tumor can form in the brain or other parts of the central nervous system (CNS), such as the spine or cranial nerves. The brain plays a central role in the control of most bodily functions, including awareness, movements, sensations, thoughts, speech, and memory. A tumor can affect the brainâ€™s ability to work properly and adequately perform such functions."

    {
        question: "What is the difference between malignant and non-malignant brain tumors?",
        answer: "Whether a tumor is malignant or not depends on how quickly the cells reproduce. If the tumor is made up of cells that multiply slowly, then it is usually non-malignant; however, if the cells multiply and spread quickly, then the tumor is malignant."

    {
        question: "What is tumor grading?",
        answer: "Tumor grade has long been a way to define the aggressiveness of a tumor, particularly for malignant brain tumors such as glioma but also for non-malignant (benign) brain tumors including meningioma."
    },
    {
        question: "What are molecular markers?",
        answer: "Not all brain tumors are the same. Some tumors have differences in the genetic or molecular makeup of the cells. These differences are called molecular markers, or biomarkers. Molecular markers are becoming increasingly important for brain tumor diagnosis and treatment."

        question: "What are the major parts of the brain?",
        answer: "The brain is made up of multiple parts, and each part is responsible for different body functions. The three major parts are the cerebrum, cerebellum, and brain stem. The cerebrum controls reading, thinking, learning, movement, speech, vision, personality, and emotions. The cerebellum controls balance for standing, walking, and other motion. The brain stem connects the brain with the spinal cord and controls basic body functions such as breathing, sleeping, body temperature, and blood pressure."

    {
        question: "What are the lobes of the brain and their functions?",
        answer: "Different lobes of the brain control different functions. The frontal lobe helps you think and reason. The temporal lobe contains the neural pathways for hearing and vision, as well as behavior and emotions. The occipital lobe is responsible for vision. The parietal lobe manages sensations such as touch, pain, and temperature."

    {
        question: "What are the common types of brain tumors?",
        answer: "The most common types of brain tumors include meningiomas, pituitary tumors, and gliomas. Meningiomas are typically benign and grow slowly. Pituitary tumors form in the pituitary gland and can affect hormone levels. Gliomas are malignant tumors that arise from glial cells and are more aggressive."

    {
        question: "What are the risk factors for brain tumors?",
        answer: "Risk factors for brain tumors include genetic and hereditary factors, exposure to high-dose ionizing radiation, and possibly exposure to certain chemicals and industrial toxins. Genetic syndromes such as Neurofibromatosis and Li-Fraumeni syndrome are associated with a higher risk of developing brain tumors."
    },
    {
        question: "How are brain tumors diagnosed?",
        answer: "Brain tumors are diagnosed through a combination of neurological exams, imaging tests such as MRI and CT scans, and biopsy procedures. Molecular markers and genetic testing may also be used to provide a more accurate diagnosis and inform treatment options."
    },
    {
        question: "What are the treatment options for brain tumors?",
        answer: "Treatment options for brain tumors vary depending on the type, location, and grade of the tumor. Common treatments include surgery, radiation therapy, and chemotherapy. Emerging treatments such as targeted therapy and immunotherapy are also being explored based on the molecular markers of the tumor."
